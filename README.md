## üé® Cosmic CMS Integration

This application uses Cosmic CMS to manage:

- **Portfolio Projects** - Project details, images, and 3D positioning
- **About Information** - Personal/company information and bio
- **Skills & Technologies** - Technical skills and proficiency levels
- **Contact Information** - Contact details and social links

The 3D scene dynamically renders content from Cosmic, allowing you to:
- Add new projects without code changes
